# Tokenmaxxing Quest — Design Document

Living design doc for the incremental browser game. Update this file whenever mechanics, architecture, or requirements change.

## Vision & Theme

**Tokenmaxxing Quest** is a satirical incremental game about a software engineer at a big tech company that incentivizes LLM token spending as a proxy for productivity — a practice known as [token maxxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_impact_of_artificial_intelligence#Token_maxxing).

The player embarks on a career quest: consume as many AI tokens as possible to earn promotions and recognition. Early on it feels like a clever hack. Over time, the systems scale — parallel agents, bloated prompts, manager dashboards — until things get **too big**.

Tone: dry corporate satire. Player-facing copy should sound like internal tooling, standups, and perf reviews.

## Hard Requirements

These are non-negotiable constraints for all versions:

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Browser-only** | Must run in a modern web browser with no install step |
| **Mobile-friendly** | Usable on phones: touch targets, readable text, single-column layout |
| **No game engine** | Render with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only — no Phaser, Pixi, Unity, etc. |
| **GitHub Pages** | Static files deployable to a free public GitHub Pages repo |
| **Performance** | Snappy UI, low battery drain on mobile — no rAF game loop, pause when tab hidden |

## Non-Goals (V0.1)

- No backend or server-side logic
- No WebGL / canvas rendering loop
- No npm build step (keep deploy simple)
- No sound, prestige, narrative events, or multiple resources

## Architecture

Inspired by [Kittens Game](https://kittensgame.com/web/) patterns, modernized with native ES modules.

```
index.html          → shell + module entry
css/main.css        → mobile-first styles
js/
  main.js           → boot, tick loop, visibility handling (composition root)
  game.js           → Game engine: rules, tick, save/load, reset
  state.js          → GameState: plain data model + save (de)serialization
  clock.js          → Clock abstraction (SystemClock, ManualClock)
  storage.js        → KeyValueStore abstraction (LocalStorageAdapter, MemoryStorage)
  resources.js      → constants, formatting, upgrade definitions
  achievements.js   → achievement definitions + unlock evaluation
  ui.js             → DOM bindings, update-on-change only
test/
  game.test.js      → engine behavior (actions, ticks, save/load, reset)
  state.test.js     → save (de)serialization + validation
  achievements.test.js → achievement unlock rules
```

### Testability & SOLID

The core logic is decoupled from the browser so it can be unit-tested headlessly:

- **Single Responsibility:** state (`state.js`), rules/coordination (`game.js`), time
  (`clock.js`), and persistence (`storage.js`) each live in their own module.
- **Dependency Inversion:** `Game` receives a `Clock` and a `KeyValueStore` via its
  constructor instead of calling `Date.now()` / `localStorage` directly.
- **Liskov substitution:** `SystemClock`↔`ManualClock` and
  `LocalStorageAdapter`↔`MemoryStorage` are drop-in interchangeable.
- `main.js` is the composition root: it injects `SystemClock` + `LocalStorageAdapter`.

Tests set up any starting `GameState`, apply actions, advance a `ManualClock` to run
ticks/offline gaps deterministically (no real waiting), and assert on the resulting
state. Run with `node --test` (Node's built-in runner — no dependencies, no build step).

### Tick loop

- **5 ticks/sec** (200 ms interval) via `setInterval`
- Model update (`game.tick()`) separated from view update (`ui.update()`)
- UI writes to DOM only when displayed string values change
- Tab hidden or window unfocused → stop tick loop, sync last tick time, save state; tab visible and focused → resume (no catch-up)

### Save strategy

- **Storage:** `localStorage` key `tokenmaxxing-quest.save.v1`
- **Autosave:** every 300 ticks (~60 s), on tab hide/blur, on `beforeunload`
- **No offline catch-up:** passive income only accrues while the tab is visible and focused
- **Version field:** `version: 1` for future migrations

### Save format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "tokens": 123,
  "rules": 4,
  "agents": 2,
  "lastTickAt": 1710000000000,
  "achievements": ["first-prompt"]
}
```

## Mechanics

### Implemented (V0.1)

| Mechanic | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Tokens** | Primary resource — company AI tokens consumed |
| **Send Prompt** | Manual click; base +1 token, plus +1 per owned Cursor Rule (with milestone multipliers) |
| **Cursor Rule** | First upgrade; base 8 tokens, ×1.10 cost growth; +1 token per prompt per rule; milestones at **15** and **40** owned (×2 each) |
| **Background Agent** | Pricier passive upgrade; base **75** tokens, ×1.14 cost growth; +1 token/s each; milestones at **25** and **60** owned (×2 each) |
| **Achievements** | Milestones that unlock from gameplay; persisted in save; top overlay banner on earn; toolbar shows earned count |
| **First Prompt** | Achievement: send your first prompt |
| **Rules of Engagement** | Achievement: buy first Cursor Rule |
| **Headcount Approved** | Achievement: buy first Background Agent |
| **Quarterly Target** | Achievement: reach 100 tokens |
| **Four Nines of Uptime** | Achievement: reach 1,000 tokens |
| **Platform Team** | Achievement: reach 10,000 tokens |
| **Cost Center of Excellence** | Achievement: reach 100,000 tokens |
| **Small Fleet** | Achievement: own 25 Background Agents |
| **Next goal UI** | Each upgrade shows afford hint (prompts and/or passive ETA) and next milestone |
| **Full token display** | Token counter always shows full digits with grouping (no K/M/B abbreviations) |
| **Active-only ticks** | Passive income and tick loop run only while the tab is visible and the window is focused |
| **Reset progress** | New game (keep achievements) or full reset (clear achievements); modal confirmation required |

### Planned

| Version | Mechanic | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| V0.2 | Parallel Agent swarm | Second upgrade; tokens/sec breakdown in UI |
| V0.3 | Prompt Bloat multiplier | More tokens, flavor “code quality” stat declines |
| V0.4 | Manager Review events | Random events; burnout debuff if over-tokenmaxxing |
| V0.5 | Prestige: Promotion | Reset progress for permanent multiplier |

## Incremental design guidance

Gameplay and economy changes should follow the project skill **incremental-game-design** (`.cursor/skills/incremental-game-design/SKILL.md`). It condenses idle/incremental design literature (Pecorella, Eric Guan, Bugnet, Machinations, and others) into actionable checklists: core loop, cost/production math, sink/source balance, pacing phases, prestige timing, and UI patterns.

Agents: apply that skill's pre-implementation checklist before any mechanic change; update this doc after shipping.

## UI/UX Guidelines

- Single-column card layout, max-width 480px
- Minimum 44×44px touch targets on all buttons
- Base font 16px; tabular nums for counters
- Dark theme by default
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables press animations
- Satirical micro-copy
- Use `aria-live="polite"` on resource panel and achievement overlay for screen readers
- Achievements and Reset open centered modals (backdrop click, Escape, or close button to dismiss)
- Toolbar chip buttons under the header for secondary actions

## Performance Checklist

- [x] 5 Hz tick (not 60 Hz rAF loop)
- [x] Pause tick loop when `document.hidden`
- [x] DOM updates only when formatted values change
- [x] No continuous CSS animations
- [x] `touch-action: manipulation` on interactive elements
- [ ] Web Worker tick timer (optional future optimization)

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

1. Push to `main` branch
2. Enable **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**
3. Workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` deploys site root
4. Live URL: `https://<username>.github.io/tokenmaxxing-quest/`

### Local development

ES modules require a local HTTP server (not `file://`):

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8080

# Node (npx)
npx serve .
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`.
